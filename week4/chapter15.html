                                    Webpack also uses the concept of 'loaders', which allows you to perform tasks such as:
                                    <ul id = "sub-list">
                                        <li id="lists">Transpiling code</li> 
                                        <li id="lists">Minifying code</li> 
                                        <li id="lists">Linting code</li> 
                                        <li id="lists">Testing code</li> 
                                        <li id="lists">Compiling CSS preprocessor files (such as Sass, Less or Stylus) into
                                            standard CSS files.</li> 
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li><br><hr>
